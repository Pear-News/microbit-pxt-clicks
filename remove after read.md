# Letter for tomorrow
Now, it's 11:27. I need to sleep and pack my school bag. Please don't use this method to finish the Project if the problem is too hard to solve.

## Way to finish this way
You must add the few results into a list because the result is 
```
A Single
B Single
A+B Single
```
Therefore, if anlayse is this combination, just output `A+B Single`, but if cannot finish, use another way.
